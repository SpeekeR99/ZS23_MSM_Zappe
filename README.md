# Multidimensional Statistical Methods

This repository contains assignments and projects from the **Multidimensional Statistical Methods** course.
The course covered a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques with a strong focus on multidimensional data analysis, using **Python** for implementation and data visualization.

## Course Overview

The goal of the course was to develop a solid understanding of statistical methods used for analyzing high-dimensional datasets.
Emphasis was placed on both theoretical concepts and practical implementation, with an extensive use of visualizations for data interpretation.

### Topics Covered
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and Dimensionality Reduction
- **Discriminant Analysis**
- **Regression Models** for Multidimensional Data
- **Classification and Prediction Methods**
- **Correlation and Distance Metrics**
- **Data Visualization** of Multidimensional Results
- and more ...

## Tools and Libraries Used

All projects were implemented using **Python**. Key libraries include:
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models
- **Plotly** for interactive visualizations
- **SciPy** for statistical computations

## How to Run

Each subdirectory contains the whole project for the assignment, including a `.bat` file for running the Python script.
Each subdirectory also contains a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary libraries for running the script.
The runnable scripts also try to install the necessary libraries if they are not already installed.
